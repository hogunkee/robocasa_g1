# Prompts: to be removed
I have three subfolders in the object folder: lightwheel, objaverse, and sketchfab. Each folder contains a collection of mesh and texture assets. I’d like to properly include license information for each asset without modifying the original repositories, as I plan to open source them. Could you help me draft a complete LICENSE file?
